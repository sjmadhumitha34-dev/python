## 🧮 RFM Scoring Logic
- **Recency (R)**: Days since last purchase  
  - Lower days → Higher score
- **Frequency (F)**: Number of orders  
  - More orders → Higher score
- **Monetary (M)**: Total spend ($)  
  - Higher spend → Higher score

Each metric is scored from **1 (lowest)** to **5 (highest)**.
